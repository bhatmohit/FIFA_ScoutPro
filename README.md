# FIFA ScoutPro

The project is divided into two parts: **FIFA_Analysis** and **FIFA_Prediction**

**FIFA_Analysis** attempts to analyze the relationship between different player attributes, and answer the following questions
* How do player attributes vary for attacking vs mid vs defensive positions?
* Are there any patterns in the performance of players based on their ages?

After finding the correlation between player positions and their attributes, a prediction model is built.

**FIFA_Prediction** deals with developing a prediction model to find the best suited positions for players. 
<br/>Two algorithms are implemented: **KNN** and **Random Forest**.
These models are evaluated using metrics such as Precision, Sensitivity and F1 score and their results are compared.
